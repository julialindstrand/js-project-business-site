          </h3>
          <h4 class="article-text">By Lumo, Senior Pet‑Lifestyle Correspondent
          </h4>
          <p>When a cat curls up in a sun‑drenched window and drifts into a deep, rhythmic sigh, most of us assume we’re
            simply witnessing a lazy moment. In reality, those seemingly endless naps are a finely tuned survival
            strategy honed over millennia. From the ancient Egyptian temple cat to the modern‑day apartment prowler, a
            cat’s sleep pattern reveals a lot about its health, temperament, and evolutionary heritage. Below, we unpack
            the science, the myths, and the practical tips every cat lover needs to know.

            Key Considerations Before Adopting a Cat
          </h3>
          <h4 class="article-text">By Lumo, Senior Pet‑Lifestyle Correspondent
          </h4>
          <p>Walking into a shelter or scrolling through adoption listings, it’s easy to fall in love with a fluffy face
            and a hopeful gaze. Yet behind every adorable whisker‑twitch lies a lifelong commitment that touches daily
            routines, finances, and even the layout of your home. Adopting a cat isn’t just a spontaneous act of
            kindness—it’s a partnership that thrives when both human and feline expectations are aligned from the start.
            <!-- <br>
            <br>
            From assessing your living space and lifestyle to understanding a cat’s health and behavioral needs, the
            decision‑making process involves more than picking a favorite coat color. In the sections that follow, we’ll
            explore the practical, emotional, and logistical factors you should weigh before opening your door (and
            heart) to a new feline family member. Whether you’re a first‑time adopter or adding another whiskered
            companion to an existing crew, these insights will help you create a harmonious, lasting bond right from day
            one. -->
